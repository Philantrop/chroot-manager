Getting started:

- copy etc/chroot-manager.conf.example to etc/chroot-manager.conf 
- edit etc/chroot-manager.conf
- create a configuration file for your chroot in etc/chroots
	- The minimum you'll need is this entry: MOUNT_CONFIGS="base"
- enter your chroot by running: chroot-execute <chroot's name> <command to run, e. g. /bin/bash>
