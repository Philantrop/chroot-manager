ToDo:
- Allow for scripted creation of new chroot, e. g.from scratch, from a tarball, etc.
- If the chroot is on a device, umount that, too.
- Add conversion of chroots to VMs.
- Write some real docs.

Done:

- Unmount things. Properly. Don't rely on config files staying the same to do the right unmounts.
